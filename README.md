# square-map

Very useful project inspired by work of Terry Atkinson and Michael Baldwin,
back from 1967: [Map of an Area of Dimensions 12" x 12" Indicating 2,304 1/4" Squares
](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/75331)

On a side note, this could be used to create squared papers easily.

To control number of cells use the following query string arguments:

* `rows` - how many rows should be rendered
* `columns` - how many columns should be rendered
* `cellWidth` - width of a single cell
* `cellHeight` - height of a single cell
